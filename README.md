# School-Final-Project
This is my Final Project in my CSCI 102 class\
I chose to make a responsive culinary style website with the following Pages
# Home
In the Home page I created a javascript image carousel that displays the different recipes on the page.
# Meals
On the meals page there is 3 dropdown lists each containing three different foods with ingrediants, instructions, and a link to an external website.\
I made sure it was easy to expand each dropdown list with more food items.
